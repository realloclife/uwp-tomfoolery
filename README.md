# Auto-updating but horribly unstable UWP script executor. Does not have proper scheduling or a hashchecker bypass yet.

NOTE: You have to do [this](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/461078-allocconsole-winapi-windows-uwp-apps.html) to your installation of UWP Roblox if you want to be able to use this properly. Otherwise, AllocConsole() simply will not work.\
NOTE #2: If you get an error upon injection via LoadLibrary, follow the DLL injection section [here](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/177183-basic-intermediate-techniques-uwp-app-modding.html).
